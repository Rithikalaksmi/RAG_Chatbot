                                                          RAG Chatbot

Abstract:
The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Chatbot integrates FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) and Gemini AI to create an intelligent chatbot capable of understanding, retrieving, and generating context-aware responses. By leveraging embedding models for vector search and Google’s Gemini API for response generation, the chatbot enhances accuracy in answering user queries based on uploaded documents (PDFs, DOCX, images, videos, etc.).
This solution enables fast, accurate, and context-aware information retrieval, making it ideal for applications such as customer support, legal document analysis, educational assistance, and enterprise knowledge management.

Objectives:

The primary objectives of this chatbot are:

•	Efficient Information Retrieval – Utilize FAISS to store and retrieve relevant document content quickly.

•	Context-Aware Question Answering – Use Google Gemini AI to generate intelligent responses based on retrieved information.

•	Multi-Format Support – Extract and process data from PDFs, DOCX, CSVs, images (OCR), and videos.

•	Scalability & Performance – Optimize vector search and response generation for real-time performance.

•	User-Friendly Interface – Provide an interactive, accessible chatbot experience via Streamlit.

 
 Features:
 
 Document Upload & Processing:
 
•	Supports PDFs, DOCX, TXT, CSV, XLSX, JPG, PNG, MP4.

•	Extracts text using PyMuPDF, python-docx, pandas, and pytesseract (OCR for images & videos).
 
  
  Efficient Search & Retrieval:
  
•	FAISS Vector Indexing enables fast search for relevant information.

•	Sentence Transformers generate embeddings for accurate similarity matching.
 
  
  Intelligent Response Generation:
  
•	Google Gemini AI formulates contextual responses based on retrieved content.

•	Handles complex queries across multiple documents.
 
  
  Scalability & Optimization:
  
•	Uses FAISS for efficient vector storage (supports millions of embeddings).

•	OpenCV processing for video OCR without excessive memory usage.

•	Supports real-time question answering.

 
  User-Friendly Deployment:
  
•	Built with Streamlit for an interactive web interface.

•	Easily deployable on cloud platforms (Streamlit Cloud, Hugging Face, AWS, etc.).



Model Architecture:

The chatbot is built on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, which consists of:

Document Processing & Embedding Generation

•	Text is extracted from uploaded files and chunked into smaller segments.

•	Each chunk is converted into a vector embedding using all-MiniLM-L6-v2.

•	Embeddings are stored in FAISS for efficient retrieval.

 
  Query Processing & FAISS Search
  
•	User input is converted into an embedding vector.

•	FAISS searches for similar document chunks based on cosine similarity.

 
  Response Generation (Gemini AI)
  
•	The retrieved context is passed to Google Gemini AI.

•	Gemini formulates a coherent, context-aware answer.

 
  User Interaction & Output Display
  
•	The answer is displayed via Streamlit’s web interface.
